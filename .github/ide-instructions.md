# IDE Instructions

## General

## Planning

Use the plan folder to write down a plan for solving any task. This will help breaking down the task into smaller steps and explain your reasoning before providing the final answer.

The plan file name should have a consecutive number and a descriptive name, for example: `plan/001-add-theme-toggle.md`.

Ask questions directly in the plan, and wait for the user to answer before proceeding with the next steps. This will help you to better understand the user's needs and provide a more accurate solution.
